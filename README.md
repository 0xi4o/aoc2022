# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm doing the Advent of Code, which is a month long coding challenge that takes place every December. It's a collection of Christmas-themed puzzles that you solve using a programming language of your choice.

Since I'm learning Rust, I think this might be a great way to get better at it. My goal is not to get a place on the leaderboard or challenge someone (although you can totally do that). Instead my goal is to challenge myself to finish the puzzle each day, no matter how much time they take.

Each puzzle has two parts. Once you finish part 1 of the puzzle, you get part 2 which could be easy or hard based on how you approached solving part 1.

This repo collects the solutions that I came up with. They might not be the best solution to the problems though.
